------

`discord-siriusxm` is not avaible on PyPi quite yet and some of its depenencies
are not yet either. As a result installting it is a bit more difficult.

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git://github.com/AngellusMortis/discord_siriusxm
    $ cd discord_siriusxm
    $ python setup.py install
